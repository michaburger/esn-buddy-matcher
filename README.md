# ESN Buddy matcher
This software contains a very simple matching algorithm for matching the local and international students. Basically, it reads the data from two csv files (one for the local and one for the international students), calculates the intercorrelation between each participant and uses a simplified version of the stable marriage problem algorithm in order to match the persons.
# How to use this software in your ESN section
The import feature is still very basic and only accepts a list in the same exact form ESN Lausanne EPFL uses. Please check the sample .csv files (with invented names and data) in order to determine how to design your registration form on Satellite. Any contributions for generalising the import process are welcome.
